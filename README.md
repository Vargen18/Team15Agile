_Instructions for how to set up our program_

This repository consists of two main folders: Documents and klingan

Documents contains all the individual reflections divided into one folder per week.

Klingan contains the source code for our product.

To start the webpage, you need to install Nodejs. After this, start CMD and navigate to the folder “klingan” in our project files.

There you will need run: 

“npm install”

 and then

 “npm start”. 

This will automatically start the program on localhost:3000 in your standard browser.
