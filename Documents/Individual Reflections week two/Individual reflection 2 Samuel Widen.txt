I will go ahead and not follow the standard questions this week, as I have failed at something way simpler, which I deem more important to reflect over. 

I did not spend even remotely enough time on the project during week 2, as I was incredibly busy with the other course. That could have been avoided however, since the reason I had so much to do was that I did not do enough the week prior. When that caught up to me, this course suffered. 

In order to avoid this in the future I have made a more detailed schedule and will spend extra effort to ensure I do not fall behind in either course.
