   B: Next week we are probably moving on to work on React (or some other programming platform), which I am not familiar with.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   A: With my previous experience from courses at the IEM programme, I explained the business model canvas for the group.
   B: Next week we’re going to work a lot with the user stories and I want to use my knowledge for making them even more centered around the customer
   A->B: Review all the user stories, look for information on the Internet for good examples of user stories and suggest changes for the group

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   A: I have written a few user stories to be put in the project back log
   B: I want to develop these user stories further and assign specific tasks to them.
   A->B: Firstly, I look for information about how an user story is broken down to tasks and then review the user stories one by one.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   A: I made the group’s draft of the description of the project scope.
   B: Next week, I want go get familiar with the programming platform and the programming language(s) we are going to work with, in order to be able to deliver to the sprint
