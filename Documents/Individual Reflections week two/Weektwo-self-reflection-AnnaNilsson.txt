What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about React and Node, a frontend and backend library that could be used to build our website. Currently my knowledge is about the libraries are limited, to learn more I will read up on their websites and talk to friends I know are well versed in them. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?/ what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The team is looking for libraries to help ease the development of the website. Currently we do not have any that we are using. I am trying to learn more about two libraries to halp the team learn more about them.    

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The team has several features and criterias they want the website to fulfill. This needs to be visualized to give the team a clearer picture of what we want to create. This is reached by creating a mockup of some pages of the website.
