Self-evaluation 
3/4 – 2020
Oliver Karmetun

What do I want to learn or understand better?
It seems we have decided on using java script as the main language for our website. We also think of using the library React. 
Therefor I would like to find some tutorials on both of these and check them out so that I can learn. I will do this during next week.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I have some experience with working in a grocery store and have a good contact with our customer, I hope to be able to offer feedback when we do our user stories from the view of the store manager. 
I will talk with the customer and show her our progress and mock ups so far.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I think that some of our user stories currently are somewhat too large and not broken down enough so I will bring this up with the team when we finalize our product backlog. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was present during the making of the model canvas.
I have been in contact with the customer and gotten some valuable info as well as documents for us to use during the project. 
For example we discussed how to organize the store, and I received an excel document with all the sections and categories of the wares. This document needed to be cleaned up before I gave it to the group. 
I will check with the customer if we can get an excel with all the products in the store
