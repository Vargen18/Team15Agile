Individual reflection – week 5 - William Gerle
	

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	  A:This week, I have been working a lot with how to store data after a page refresh and also between our different pages. 
	  B:Next week, I would like to further develop my knowledge withing sessionStorage and LocalStorage.
	  A->B: How I am gonna get to B is in collaboration with my teammates and by experimenting with the code and watching YouTube.
	

	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	  A: This week, since Max and I had been working on localStorage we tried to explain for the group how this works by showing our code and discussing during the meetings.
	  B: Next week, I hopefully got more knowledge of localStorage and maybe also how to get data from an Excelsheet and hopefully I will be able to share this with the group.
	  A->B: I need to further develop my skills withing localStorage and also learn how to get data from excelsheets. I will use internet for this to find information.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	A: This week, I discussed some changes for our daily scrum meetings with the group. The plan is to have better structure and try to get the daily scrum meetings shorter and more effective.
	B: Next week, I hope to implement the above discussed changes when having our daily scrum meetings.
	A->B: I will do this by trying our new structure during the meetings and maybe be more active to hold the new structure and make sure it works.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	   A: This week, my contribution was the implementation of localStorage which was vital for our website to work properly.
	   B: Next week, I hope to develop our localStorageCode and also maybe get a good way to import the goods from the excelsheet.
	   A->B: I plan to get to B by experimenting and watching videos and of course also, in collaboration with my team members.
