What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to continue to learn more about CSS, specifically bootstrap and how it works together with react. This will as always be done by reading documentation. 


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?/ what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have helped the group, mostly the smaller group I have programmed with, find new resources, documentation and good options for CSS. These have also been linked so that the entire group can take part of them.  


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

I have coded CSS for several elements in the application together with my smaller programming group. I have also helped structure user stories.
