Individual reflection week 5 by Johannes Kvernes

What do I want to learn or understand better?
(A) What do I know now?
As I was one of the team members who was tasked with making the site look better, I have learned about bootstrap and its components.
(B) What do I want to learn?
I thought it was fun to create bootstrap components, so I would like to learn more about that. However, that will not be next week because we will focus on other things that produce more value.
(A -> B) How do I learn it?
Read guides and code a lot.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
(A) What have I done to help the team?
I have come up with ideas on to improve the code, and how to make the structure of the code better.
(B) What do I want to do to help someone learn something new?
I can give those who need it some pointers.
(A -> B) How do I want to help someone else learn something new?
Apply my programming knowledge.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
(A) What have I contributed with?
Honestly, not much. Last week I said I would speak more and give feedback and such, but I didnâ€™t really do that.
(B) What do I want to contribute with?
Keep the Trello board updated as usual. Speak more and give more ideas and feedback about things I have opinions about.
(A -> B) How can I accomplish that?
Spend some time to check if the user stories should be changed or remain the way they are. Also really try to speak more.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
(A) What have I contributed with?
I have coded (mostly css and bootstrap), and written part of the team reflection.
(B) What do I want to contribute with?
I want to code more. Next week I want to focus a lot on creating value for the client, so I will pick highly prioritized user stories that we have avoided until now.
(A -> B) How can I contribute?
Code a bunch.
