Self-evaluation 
15/5 – 2020
Oliver Karmetun

What do I want to learn or understand better?:
Right now, we are unsure of what the stakeholder wants us to focus on for the last week. I will talk with her during the weekend in order to clear these things up. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?:
I reorganized the user stories with the feedback from our stakeholder during the last weekend. I will check with the stakeholder during the weekend again to see what user stories we should focus on for the last week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?: 
I have been working with Samuel and Adam in order to enable sending an order to the store page. I also helped another group who was stuck with showing all products. 
We did a mixture of programming alone and together.
