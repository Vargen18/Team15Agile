Everything is same as last week.


(A) What have I contributed with?
Created a checkout page, complete with everything that entails. It sends the order and clears the cart. The order shows up on the “handlare” page.
(B) What do I want to contribute with?
Try to tie up loose ends before the project ends
(A -> B) How can I contribute?
Discuss hard with the other team members what we want to fix and what gets left unfinished since the next week will be the last for project development.
