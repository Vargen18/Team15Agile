Self-evaluation 
27/3 – 2020
Oliver Karmetun

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Being that we are going to be making a website, I would like to learn more about how to create a website. For example, what tools and languages should be used. 
I will talk with my team members about their experience and then see if I can find some online tutorials.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There are two persons in the group that haven’t done as much programming as the others. So I hope that I can help them get started with GitHub and such. We will try to do a workshop during week 2. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
There were two persons in the group who weren’t that familiar with scrum. Thus we introduced them to the concept and the tool that we are going to use (Trello). 
We should go through our work flow in more detail during the next week after the exercises. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was present and active during the writing of the group social contract. 
I have also got us in contact with a customer as well as found a project that the team have decided to go with.
In preparation of introducing this idea to the team and examiners I also wrote a 1 and ½ page description of the project. This included the problem that we should solve as well as a proposed solution for it.  The document can be found under “idéer” in our google drive repository.
This document can be polished and translated to be used in next weeks turn in.
