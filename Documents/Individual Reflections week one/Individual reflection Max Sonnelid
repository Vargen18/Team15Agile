Individual reflection – week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better?
   I am very excited to develop my ability to complete a complex project in a team. Throughout my time at Chalmers, I have found out that what develops me most is not to learn the actual subjects, but to learn how to cooperate to solve tasks together. Especially, I would like to take a leadership position in some part of the project, in order to learn how to delegate tasks and to find the best methods for solving a task.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   I think I could contribute the most with my previous experience of working together with businesses and contributing towards fulfilling a customer need. This is something that I have done in several other courses at Chalmers, and also outside of Chalmers, and find this ability very relevant for this project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   As Scrum is a totally new working method for me, my contributions this week were very limited. However, I contributed with my previous experience of working together in a project, for example that I organized the meeting protocols.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   I contributed e.g. by finding examples of projects from previous year, which gave the group inspiration for finding our project. Also, I started a Slack channel, which was the initial mean of communication for the group
