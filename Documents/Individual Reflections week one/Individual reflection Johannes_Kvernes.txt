Individual reflection week 1 by Johannes Kvernes

What do I want to learn or understand better?
(A) What do I know now?
I have taken a course which was partly focused on agile process management, so I know a little bit about it.
(B) What do I want to learn?
I am not quite sure about KPIs, and would like to learn more about how to measure things that provide value for our team.
(A -> B) How do I learn it?
Look through slides again, search about it, discuss with the group or others.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
(A) Is there something that someone does not know how to do?
There are members of the group who have not used git.
(B) What do I want to do to help someone learn something new?
I could teach the people who have not used git before how to use it.
(A -> B) How do I want to help someone else learn something new?
We will have a github session next week. I could be active there. Also when we start coding.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
(A) What have I contributed with?
Not much to be honest.
(B) What do I want to contribute with?
I plan on keeping the Trello board updated and organized. If we decide to use other things for organization I will do the same there.
(A -> B) How can I contribute?
This one is pretty straight forward, just do it.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
(A) What have I contributed with?
I came up with an idea for a project.
(B) What do I want to contribute with?
I wanna code alot. But I will do other things as well, like coming up with ideas for features of the product.
(A -> B) How can I contribute?
I don't really need a plan to code, that's gonna happen automatically. But I will spend some time designated to coming up with feature ideas.
