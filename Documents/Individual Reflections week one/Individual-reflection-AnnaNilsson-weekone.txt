What do I want to learn or understand better?
I do not fully understand how KPI’s work. I would like to learn more about them and how our group will work with them. I will learn this by reading up myself and discussing with my group how we should apply them to our project. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?/ what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The group is looking at trello to use as a base for Scrum. But some in the group have not used this before and are uncertain of how to use it. Me and some other hold a walkthrough, present important features so that they feel comfortable using it.  

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The team has several ideas to begin with. The project should only contain one of them. Together we select one of the ideas by discussing and and getting some feedback from the teachers.
