Self-evaluation 
24/4 – 2020
Oliver Karmetun

What do I want to learn or understand better?:
I want a better understanding of how to accomplish persistence within the website. I will check with the 
people who are familiar with databases to see if they know anything. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?: 
I will continue to assist with what I know regarding grocery stores and 
online implementations of them in order to help improve our prioritizing. 
I will also keep in contact with our customer in order to get their input.
This week my group have become comfortable with using routing to switch between pages. 
We will try to push the usage of this to the rest of the team since it simplified our code greatly.   

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?:
I will check with the stakeholder during the weekend to see if reprioritization of our user stories is necessary. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?: 
I have been working together with Johannes and Anna in 
order to finalize the user story “As store manager I want 
to see multiple orders”. Our workflow was very good. 
As usual, we worked only on one computer, so commits are between all of us. 
We met some problems when it came to saving data on the website, so this was brought up 
during the meeting on Thursday and we decided that one pair would work with this issue during 
the next sprint.
