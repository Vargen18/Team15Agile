Self-evaluation 
24/4 – 2020
Oliver Karmetun

What do I want to learn or understand better?:

I now a better understanding of react and how to use it. 
I still feel that I can learn some more regarding websites 
in general work and how to switch between pages, so I will look 
for information about this next week. It will be a great help 
for the user story I and two other team members are going to be 
implementing (Switching between orders) as well.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?: 

I will continue to assist with what I know regarding grocery stores and 
online implementations of them in order to help improve our prioritizing. 
I will also keep in contact with our customer in order to get their input.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?:

Multiple team members brought up the fact that our user stories where to large 
and not broken up well enough into acceptance criteria.  We will thus look over 
this for the next sprint. 
There also might be the issue that our user stories do not offer value by themselves, 
we will discuss this further. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?: 

I have been working together with Johannes and Anna in 
order to finalize the user story “As store manager I want 
to see an order”. Our workflow according to me was perfect. 
We programmed on one computer at a time, so I don’t have any 
commits, but we were all present and active during our coding 
sessions.
